<p>Hi! I am Göksu Güvendiren, a senior Computer Science student in the Middle East Technical
University, Turkey. This page has been started with the purpose of representing my homework
 for a course I am taking in the Spring2017, Advanced Ray Tracer. However, I think it is going to become some kind
 of a blog, despite my inability to write :)
 </p>

<p>If you wish to see how I am doing with that course, you can always check the <a href="https://goksu.me/projects">
Projects</a>, I will try to keep it up-to-date as much as I can. Also, I think you will be able to see more 
than my ray tracer, but who knows what the future holds :)</p>

<p> Hoping to see you in future projects :)
